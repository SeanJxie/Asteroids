Draws a given image in MS paint automatically.


- To change image, edit the ```file``` argument in the ```pixel_draw_list``` var in ```draw.py```.
- To change from black and white to full colour drawing, change between the ```image_scan_col``` and ```image_scan_black``` funtions in the ```pixel_draw_list``` var.
- Note: the ```image_scan_black``` function is kind of buggy.
