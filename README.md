# Asteroids
My own take on the classic Asteroids game. Written in Python.
- Currently in development.
- Practice project for game development. So, the graphics are polygon-based and RGB defined colors.
- The repository structure may seem messy. I'm trying to figure out how to compile python code ATM.
# Usage
- Requires Python 3.
- Install arcade library.
- Run in an IDE.
