# Asteroids
My own take on the classic Asteroids game. Written in Python.
- Currently in development.
- Practice project.
- The repository structure may seem messy. I'm trying to figure out how to compile python code ATM.
# Usage
Requires Python 3.
In cmd, ```pip install arcade``` to get arcade library. Download all files and run ```main.py``` on the command line or in IDE of choice.
