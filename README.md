# Asteroids
My own take in the classic Asteroids game. Written in Python.
- Currently in development.
- Practice project.
- The repository structure may seem messy. I'm trying to figure out how to compile python code ATM.
# Usage
```pip install arcade``` to get arcade library. Run in IDE of choice.
